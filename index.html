        <h3>Taco Trivia</h3>
        <details>
            <summary>When did tacos first appear in the United States?</summary>
            Tacos are believed to have originated in Mexico, long before the arrival of the Spanish. Ancient Mexicans used freshly made, soft, flat corn tortillas with fillings like fish and cooked organs as a staple meal that provided vital nutrients and energy.3 Mexican silver miners likely invented the taco, and Mexican Americans in the Southwest reinvented it. Jeffrey M. Pilcher, a professor of history at the University of Minnesota, suggests that the dish started around the 18th century in Mexican silver mines because the sticks of dynamite used in the mining process were referred to as "tacos" and had a shape similar to the dish we eat today.0 The term "taco" is what miners would call the charges used to excavate the silver, which were made from "pieces of paper that they would wrap around gunpowder and insert into the holes they carved in the rock face." The taco is a beloved treat that originated in Mexico, with some influences from Spanish, American, and Arab cuisine.1 Many tacos involve a fresh tortilla snuggling savory toppings of meat and veggies with sides like cheese, lemon, or lime.2
